Better-Convex ORM provides a Drizzle-style `delete()` builder for Convex mutations.

## Delete Rows

```ts
import { eq } from 'better-convex/orm';

await db.delete(users).where(eq(users.email, 'dan@example.com'));
```

To delete all rows in a table (use with care):

```ts
await db.delete(users);
```

## Returning

```ts
const deleted = await db
  .delete(users)
  .where(eq(users.email, 'dan@example.com'))
  .returning();

const ids = await db
  .delete(users)
  .where(eq(users.email, 'dan@example.com'))
  .returning({ id: users._id });
```

## Drizzle Differences

<Callout icon={<AlertTriangle />}>
- SQL-only features like `limit`, `orderBy`, and `WITH` clauses are not applicable
- Deletes are executed against Convex documents; there is no SQL `DELETE FROM ...`
</Callout>

<Callout icon={<InfoIcon />}>
Foreign key actions and RLS policies are enforced at runtime for ORM deletes when you create the DB with `createDatabase(...)`. Direct `ctx.db.delete(...)` bypasses these checks.
</Callout>
